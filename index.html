  <h1>I don’t leave here anymore
I was once central to this house
But I don’t live here anymore
I was always silent
You wouldn’t know, I don’t live here anymore
What remains of me can be hidden
Go ahead I don’t live here anymore
I know I left a hole 
I don’t care I don’t live here anymore
So I used to smoke
Don’t worry, I don’t live here anymore
I would think I’ve been replaced
I don’t know I don’t live here anymore
 
How could I know
I don’t live here anymore
I don’t live here anymore
